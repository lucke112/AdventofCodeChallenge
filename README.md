## Challenges
There are in total of 25 challenges that all have two parts of a problem that needs to be solved. The first problem is usually the easier problem and when completed you get the chance to tackle the secound problem that is harder. If you haven't cleared the first part you wont be able to advance to the secound part of the daily challenge. To clearify a bit the challenges you can do in any order you like and whenever you want. But the secound part that are a part of a challenge can only be accessed when the first part of the challenge have been cleared.
